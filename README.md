# Interview protocol for conducting interviews in the context of the research study

In this study, **semi-structured interviews** were designed for collecting qualitative data. Consequently, the authors designed a core set of questions, and then depending on the participants' inputs and the available time, the set of questions was adjusted. The interview questions were structured and grouped based on the identified Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE) levels of analysis and concepts that were explained in the research study conducted by Lenberg et al. [1]. The structure of the interview consisted of nine phases:

- **Introduction:** A bried explanation of the research, the purpose and usage of the participants' responses. In this phase interviewees consent for recording the interview and analyzing their data.
- **Background:** This part explores the interviewee's background, role, and experience with AI.
- **General Questions for AI-driven Organizational Change:** This section discusses the general impressions of participants related to the AI integration process, such as success factors and challenges for the smooth adoption of AI.
- **Individual Level:** This phase focuses on the individual BSE concepts that are discussed in the BSE literature. In this context, terms, such as _Motivation_, _Stress_, and _Attitudes_, are included.
- **Group Level:** This segment of the interview examines the potential impact of AI integration on the BSE group level of analysis, emphasizing on concepts like _Group Dynamics_ and _Collaboration_.
- **Organizational Level:** This section investigates the BSE concepts within the organizational level of analysis that affect the process of AI integration. In this context, terms, such as _Organizational Culture_ and _Politics_, are mentioned.
- **Future Perspectives and Long-Term Impacts:** Focuses on the individual perceptions and feelings for the future of AI, the potential impact on the workflow, the behavioral challenges that AI raises and the next day that will bring for the market. 
- **Closing remarks:** Open questions regarding the journey of AI Transformation, things that participants would do differently if they had to start from scratch, and final relevant thoughts and perspectives that participants want to share after the discussion.
- **Conclusion:** Brief explanation of the next steps, the strategy to analyze the data and an explanation of the timeline of the research.
